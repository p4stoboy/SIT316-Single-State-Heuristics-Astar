### Oscar Harris | A* | Single State Implementation

---

This is an A* implementation which runs against a randomised, discrete 2d area where the path cost is calculated against the differential in terrain height between tiles.

There is a functional deploy of this program at https://jolly-boba-aa9809.netlify.app/ where the start and end coordinates can be mutated and the path visualised.

It is using p5.js for rendering which is simply a wrapper over the HTML Canvas API that mimics the functionality of the Java Processing library.
